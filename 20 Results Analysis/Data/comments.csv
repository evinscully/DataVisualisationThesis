2,"I’m seriously interested in these results. The survey was clear, and easy to follow. I enjoyed the contextualised questions a lot. Good luck Evan xo"
3,The 15 seconds gave me all the time I needed haha! Got through it much better this time. Maybe a few more options (5) for visual and verbal - Cathal
7,I love you Evin
8,Really interesting topic! 
9,"For the question on toothbrush sales the figures appeared extremely different. Hence, the answer I gave was arbitrary. I did not see how they could have used the same data. Good luck with everything :)"
11,That was class craic! A real workout for the noggin!
13,that was hard. clearly explained though
19,This was extremely interesting. I'd love to be able to get the accuracy of my responses returned!
22,"Fuckn, graphs are hard man "
29,Interested in your thesis.  Share results when done? beardybe@gmail.com 
35,Super fun
37,Looking at some of the graphs gave me an aneurysm
39,There were questions where I wasn't sure if I should answer in the persona or give the honest answer (i.e. some of the charts are tactfully deceptive)
41,Good survey. Hope you find good findings. 
45,Nice sense of humour throughout this! Very enjoyable! 
52,Nice colour palette
55,Really interesting
56,it takes too much time
59,I have no idea how wrong those were and it's killing me
61,Great survey!
73,Thank you
74,Xoxo
80,This was a fun survey!
81,Were the hints in the test round false? 
82,brain = sore
84,I am you
89,None of these really asses proper info graphics. Don't focus on typical charts. Have a search of infographics on Pinterest and see what the are really like
91,I am less good at visual learning than I thought. 
93,quite an abstract exercise. 
98,"For the question with rainfall, I would have recommnended different answers depending on what the graph is trying to show i.e. the bar graphs let one read specific data better but the 3D graph shows a comparison quite well"
106,Best of luck with your thesis!
108,Difficult to tell the angles/comparisons without a reference line. Reference lines/datum help a lot when comparing info. You'll probably notice that in the results anyway. Best of luck with the Thesis. Cian.
112,I’m too dyspraxic for this 
115,V interesting!
118,Nah
119,Good luck! 
120,That one with the orange and blue circle really messed me up and now I’m really uncertain if I know anything 
123,Fun figuring it out!
129,"Nice survey my brother, I hope your thesis goes swimmingly. Love Regdar (I think that's my name)"
